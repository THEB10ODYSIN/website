        The History of Tennessee's Oldest Funeral Home Establishment. 
        Before the first postage stamp came into being or the first locomotive whistle was heard 
        in Robertson County; Marion Henry had started a company that would remain a 
        family business for 150 years- making it the oldest family funeral home 
        in the state of Tennessee.
